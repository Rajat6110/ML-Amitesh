# 🚀 My Machine Learning Journey

This repository contains everything I’ve learned and practiced in Machine Learning, all in one place. It includes my notebooks, datasets, experiments, and projects that show my progress from ML basics to advanced models.

I built this repo to stay consistent, practice daily, and gain real hands-on experience instead of only focusing on theory.
